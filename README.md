# Practicing Keyboard Shortcuts

### Purpose:
Creating repo, code, terminal, directory creation/navigation using the keyboard only.

### Easy to do with keyboard:
- Creating & editing files and directories
- Code and Git Commands

### Not so easy without a mouse:
- Navigate website using tab

### Anything we noticed:
- Lots of commands to do what we need within terminal. This text was edited using 'Nano', not via README.md directly.
